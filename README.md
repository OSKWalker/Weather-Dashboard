# Grading Requirement

Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

# Project Description

The objective of this exercise is to build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser with dynamically updating HTML and CSS. I leveraged the power of the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for locations and "localStorage" for holding persistent data where required.

Should the user need to see the weather outlook for multiple cities in order to plan a trip, they could utilize this app to...

> > - use the form input to search for a city and find current and future conditions for that city. (The city will be stored in a search history).
>
> > - see the city name, date, an icon representing the current weather conditions as well as the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index.
>
> > - gauge the UV index condition based on a color-coded system: (LOW: 0-2, MODERATE: 3-5, HIGH: 6-7, VERY HIGH: 8-10, EXTREME: 11+).
>
> > - see a forecast of up to 5 days showing the same information for those days (minus the UV Index).
>
> > - review the information from previous searches by clicking on the buttons for the respective search location.
